The `fgets()` function allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to read, which helps prevent buffer overflow attacks. Here's how you can modify the code:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char name[50]; // Adjust the size as needed\n\n    printf(\"Enter your name: \");\n    fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);\n\n    // Remove the newline character if present\n    size_t len = strlen(name);\n    if (len > 0 && name[len - 1] == '\\n') {\n        name[len - 1] = '\\0';\n    }\n\n    printf(\"Your name is: %s\\n\", name);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Remediation:\n- **Use `fgets()`:** This function reads a line from standard input and stores it in the specified buffer, ensuring that it does not exceed the buffer size.\n- **Check and Remove Trailing Newline:** After reading the input, check if there is a newline character at the end of the string. If present, remove it to ensure proper null-termination of the string.\n- **Adjust Buffer Size:** The buffer `name` in this example has been set to 50 characters.
